-------------------------------------------  TODO  -------------------------------------------------

- General: {
    - General coherence in styling
}

- PAGES: {
    - there are pages with JS 
}

WEEKLY: {
    - Adding location, time thingies ( Am thinking of click events that trigger a small timed popus(sleek, impactfull))
    - Optional: Dynamic data fetching for coordinator data 
}

- Verses: {
    - Make a component out of it
    - Move the array of verses to a js file under `/src/assets.data`
}

- Modals: {
    - I am seeing a modal in the resources page (i.e from the script.js code)
    - Consider also making a component out of the modal and leverage props for reusability:
            - ponder on the design and the props to pass to make it truely reusable
            - the fireship video on framer is really helpful, check it out 
            - the backdrop component there, can we make it even more reusable for splash screen loads ?
    
    - Also consider having the `form.js` js integrated into it since they're related
}

Leaders Page 2: {
    - setting width and height to 100 view dimensions displays bg image correctly but I am concerned about the sidebar
    - responsive design
    - functionality -JS, and not forgetting the WhatsApp integration thing
    - root(animation duration, border radius, actual main image and thumbnail item positions)
    - If it could break on larger screens, consider having maximum dimensions and work proportions from there
}


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------- ISSUES -------------------------------------------------
Leaders Page 3: {
    - The cursor:active thingy doesn't reset after the first grap - it maintains that state 'grabbing' after the first instance
}

Footer: {
    - The `hr` isn't visible even when the browser (via developer tools) can recorgnize it 
}

WhatsApp: {
    - Find a way to incorporate a device check to add an isMobile state (i.e taretting web vs mobile app)
    - CONSIDER MAKING IT A COMPONENT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ONE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
      - Props {
          - A name for whoever the button is to be to 
          - A classname in the case of diff styling 
          - A phone number
          - QUESTION: Should the message also be dynamic - For now Ima have it the same everywhere
      }
}


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------- IDEAS FOR LATTER --------------------------------------------
LOGOS:{ 
    - thinking of passing in svg syntax instead of an image to the anchor tags
    - I remember in the React lessons there was a way of returning DOM elements
    - This way, we can tweak the colors via css - OPENS DOORS TO MORE STYLING
}

Nav: {
    - implement the expand-on-hover functionality
    - Sync the expand animations on mobile - they look a bit ugly when toggling the bar
}

Leaders Page 2 {
    - Optimizing the page- startig with the images;
        - some thoughts crossed my mind: 
            - what of, if it still performance intensive, how about droping the diff backgrounds, 
            after all we are animating the main image. But hey, just a thought. I am not one to give up that easily

}

- LATER: Bringing framer motion to the game and refactoring the codebase into React world (React, Framer, Tailwind)
- considering use of the diff svg arrows for micro-interactions. e.g leaders page - hoveing over arrows
