    }

    - Resources: {
        - Ensure downloadables are Downloadable
    }

    - Modal - Incorporating the forms
}

NOW: {
    - Landing {
        - the Content at the header main portion 
        - The testimonials {
            - create a component for each testimonial and have multiple instances
            - Bring in a slider component npm store and have it there for now 
            - consult the AI to: 
              - See if we can identify the problem
              - incorporate the JS and hence a fully functional and independent React component 
              - Turn it into a reusable component that takes in the children (or an array of so )
        }
        - Modal component to Handle alerts( wait could console.alert() help us ? )
    }

    - SUPPORT {
        button event to scroll to the payment-section section 
    }
}

- INCORPORATING THE UE OF ICON AS A COMPONENT
- CREATING THE IMAGE SLIDER COMPONENT - e.g use in landing carousels
- NUMBERS ODOMETER EFFECT COMPONENT

- Get actual data to some of the links from leaders and other developers
- Self-Hosting fonts 
- Weekly activity descriptions 
- Modal incorporation - the actual input thingies 
- Support page general support 

- Make an Image slider component from the leaders page slider (single source of truth): {
    - PROPS:
       - An Array of content (e.g images); not sure for the case of leaders page (either leave as is, or incorporate the component with, say `children`)
       - Probably a boolean value to 'toggle' stuff like dragging, the dots, 
}

- 'Point' all Home to Landing, as we work on the Home later ... (Nav, React Router )
- Re-Learn returning JSX - refactor to use of svgs instead of images
- MODAL COMPONENT NEEDED FOR ALARTS (e.g Sorry, Page/ Feature currenlty under development)
   - props: {
      - Message / content (If we can return JSX, can we also pass it in as a component -oh, children ?)
      - 
   }

HOME/LANDING: {
    - OPTIMIZING THE IMAGES .....
    - What's important to the user:
       - registration  ( a recommended user )
       - who are we     ( curious user + general )
       - credibility and trust  ( General )
       - Niche: ( fellow Christian organizations/ institutional groups)
           - Soul Winning (tape... thingy)
           - Members
           - 
       
       - Activities 
       - People - they say images and videos speek munch than words
}

- General: {
    - General coherence in styling
}

- PAGES: {
    - there are pages with JS 
}

WEEKLY: {
    - Adding location, time thingies ( Am thinking of click events that trigger a small timed popus(sleek, impactfull))
    - Optional: Dynamic data fetching for coordinator data 
}

- Verses: {
    - Make a component out of it
    - Move the array of verses to a js file under `/src/assets.data`
}

- Modals: {
    - I am seeing a modal in the resources page (i.e from the script.js code)
    - Consider also making a component out of the modal and leverage props for reusability:
            - ponder on the design and the props to pass to make it truely reusable
            - the fireship video on framer is really helpful, check it out 
            - the backdrop component there, can we make it even more reusable for splash screen loads ?
    
    - Also consider having the `form.js` js integrated into it since they're related
}

Leaders Page 2: {
    - setting width and height to 100 view dimensions displays bg image correctly but I am concerned about the sidebar
    - responsive design
    - functionality -JS, and not forgetting the WhatsApp integration thing
    - root(animation duration, border radius, actual main image and thumbnail item positions)
    - If it could break on larger screens, consider having maximum dimensions and work proportions from there
}


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------- ISSUES -------------------------------------------------
Nav: {
    - The font colors broke, no Idea of the cause ...
}

Leaders Page 3: {
    - The cursor:active thingy doesn't reset after the first grap - it maintains that state 'grabbing' after the first instance
}

Footer: {
    - The `hr` isn't visible even when the browser (via developer tools) can recorgnize it 
}

WhatsApp: {
    - Find a way to incorporate a device check to add an isMobile state (i.e taretting web vs mobile app)
    - CONSIDER MAKING IT A COMPONENT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ONE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
      - Props {
          - A name for whoever the button is to be to 
          - A classname in the case of diff styling 
          - A phone number
          - QUESTION: Should the message also be dynamic - For now Ima have it the same everywhere
      }
}


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------- IDEAS FOR LATTER --------------------------------------------
LOGOS:{ 
    - thinking of passing in svg syntax instead of an image to the anchor tags
    - I remember in the React lessons there was a way of returning DOM elements
    - This way, we can tweak the colors via css - OPENS DOORS TO MORE STYLING
}

Nav: {
    - implement the expand-on-hover functionality
    - Sync the expand animations on mobile - they look a bit ugly when toggling the bar
}

Leaders Page 3: {
    - a pointer event on the main/leader image on smaller devices to trigger a modal for the full image 

}

Leaders Page 2 {
    - Optimizing the page- startig with the images;
        - some thoughts crossed my mind: 
            - what of, if it still performance intensive, how about droping the diff backgrounds, 
            after all we are animating the main image. But hey, just a thought. I am not one to give up that easily

}

- LATER: Bringing framer motion to the game and refactoring the codebase into React world (React, Framer, Tailwind)
- considering use of the diff svg arrows for micro-interactions. e.g leaders page - hoveing over arrows
